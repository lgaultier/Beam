%The use of tracers to understand and quantify physical processes such as general circulation, meso-scale and sub-mesoscale processes, eddies, vertical transport, injection, ageing, ventilation, iso- and diapycnal mixing

The subject of this talk is the inversion of sub-mesoscale information to correct mesoscale velocity. 
In other words we are using tracer observations from space to improve the estimation of the oceanic circulation. 
(This topic is slighlty different from the previous one since we are using tracer observations from space to control dynamics.) 

I am currently working in LEGI Laboratory and one of our field of expertise is the use of observation to correct models and improve prediction.}

%Nowadays many observations are avalaible. Among them, spacial observations provide data with an extended range of scales. 
%Using High Resolution satellite, we recently discovered that sub-mesoscale dynamics have a great impact not only on biogeochemistry in the ocean but also on larger scale dynamics. My study is on the use of these small scales information to correct larger scales dynamics such as mesoscale velocity  }

For a long time, the Team has developped usefull tools in Modeling and Data Assimilation using satellites data. 
With the developpement of high resolution tracer satellites, we are looking for new methods to use efficiently this huge amount of data and take into account the sub-mesoscale.\\  
Altimetric satellites has provided valid data for more than 15 years. 
Using radars, the altimeter measures the sea surface height along its track. \\
Here is a map representing the tracks of altimetric satellites during 10 days. 
It is common to use the derived velocity assuming that the geostrophic hypothesis is valid (Large scale motion, Equilibrium of Rotation and Pressure forces). 

In AVISO products, the tracks have been interpolated in time and space to build a map of ssh. \\
In the following study, the mesoscale velocity is the geostrophic velocity from altimetry (AVISO). \\ %advection much smaller than Coriolis).\\
Data Assimilation aims at finding the optimal estimate between several sources of information. Is is commonly used to correct models using observations. \\
The Sub-mesoscale is the intermediate between the mesoscale and dissipative scales.
Some recent studies have brought to light the energetic and dynamic importance of the sub-mesoscale. \\ 
%The advection cannot be ignored anymore.  
%Sub-mesoscale dynamics is completely different from the larger scales one and is triggered mainly by frontogenesis, straining by the mesoscale turbulent field and submesoscale baroclinic instability. 
Sub-mesoscale patterns in the ocean can easily be observed using High Resolution tracer observation.
In the following study, I will refer to tracer as tracer observable from space. 
It includes mainly Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Color. }}

  \note{ Many scales are present in the ocean, from climatology to molecular processes. The scales in which we are interested are located between 1km and 100 km, in the green circle. 
The sub-mesoscale dynamic is mainly observed from few hundred meters to 10 km. \\
%%%WARNING
%Mesoscale dynamics cascade into sub-mesoscale dynamics. 
%%%WARNING
At sub-mesoscales there is a strong interaction between the physics and the biogeochemistry so that the sub-mesoscale dynamics impact tracer fields. \\
Altimetric satellites can observe dynamics but are currently limitted to the mesoscale, and can provide at best one map a week, whereas tracer sensors have a fine resolution in space and time. 
We can get nearly a map a day with a resolution as low as 200m.  
We need to find a way to analyse this high resolution data set and extract dynamic information.\\

In the context of SWOT and SARAL projects, which will provide high resolution data (image),  we are also looking for new methods to analyse the huge amount of data.}

We look for the correction of this background the most compatible with the tracer information, therfore we need to measure the distance between mesoscale velocity and tracer information. 
We cannot directly look at the difference between those two different physical variables. 
We need a go-between variable to enable this two representations of the region to discuss together.

We get a sample of the velocity by computing the sub-space of velocity errors, and we add this perturbation to the background velocity.

The left picture represents the variation of the cost function along two directions of our space of errors. 
We can clearly see a global minimum. It means that we can identify the velocity that minimizes the cost function.
The right picture represents the minimization of the cost function. \\ 
The proxy inversion seems possible. Therefore, We can go through the second step: the full inversion. \\ 
In the left picture the variation of the cost function along two directions seems far more irregular than in the first step. 
We can feel that it is going to be harder to find the velocity that minimizes the cost function. 
We can also see in the process of the minimization of the cost function that several local minima exists. It is not obvious to determine which one is the global minumum.  }

The correction applied on the velocity is coherent with the observation of the tracer.

  \end{block}
  \note{Altimetric data and tracer data are used together to build a better data set. 
This study shows how to make up for the sub-sampling in time and space of altimetry using Tracer information. 
We also proved that sub-mesoscale tracer information can control larger scale dynamics in the ocean. 
Still, we need to quantify the error made on this new estimation of the velocity. 
A similar study on a coupled physico-biogeochemical model should be interesting to improve the method and quantify the resulting error. 
An interesting prospect is to generalize the method and compute a full data assimilation of image in a coupled physico-biogeochemical model.
