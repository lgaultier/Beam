More precisely, the information provided by images of tracers such as the Sea Surface Temperature or the Chlorophyll is used to correct the assessment of the circulation made by altimetric satellites.  
The originality of this talk is the use of Data Assimilation strategy to control ocean circulation.

    %altimetry not efficient to represent sub-mesoscale
First of all, the dynamic of the ocean is currently observed from space by altimetric satellites. 
Using radars, the altimeter measures the sea surface height along its track. \\
Here is a map representing the tracks of altimetric satellites during 15 days.
It is common to use the derived velocity assuming that the geostrophic hypothesis is valid.
It is clear on this picture that altimetry is not sufficient to represent the sub-mesoscale.  
Nonetheless, Sub-mesoscale patterns can easily be observed using High Resolution tracer observation from satellites. In this picture, the tracer is the Chlorophyll observed by MODIS sensor, but we can as well use as a tracer the Sea Surface temperature
%In the following study, I will refer to tracer as tracer observable from space.
%It includes mainly Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Color. 
So we aim at Considering tracer information to improve the assessment of the dynamic made by altimetry.

To do so, the framework of this study is a data assimilation problem. 
Data Assimilation aims at finding the optimal solution between two different kinds of information. In our problem, we use a data assimilation strategy but so far without a model. 
In our problem, we have information from altimetry (at a resolution 1/3, with a map a week) and from the tracer image (at a resolution of 1km and with a map a day). 
The goal of this method is %to find the optimal velocity correction that consider information form the High Resolution image.

We are looking for the correction to be applied on a background velocity such as the geostrophic mesoscale altimetric velocity field so that the corrected velocity field is a better match to the tracer image.
The goal of this study is to measure the distance between a mesoscale velocity and the high resolution image and to look for the mesoscale velocity as close as possible to the tracer image. \\
The direct measure of the distance between the tracer and the velocity field is not feasible. 
Therefore, a go-between variable is needed.

  \note{
The method to find this velocity uses the same strategies as the one used in Data Assimilation. 
The FSLE and the norm of the tracer gradient are binarized, so that we compare similar quantities. 
For a given velocity u, we measure the distance between the binarized FSLE (derived from this velocity u) $\lambda(u)$,  and the observation (ie, norm of the gradient tracer binarized).
 The background error is supposed to be small (the mesoscale altimetric velocity field is quite reliable at large scale). 
Therefore, a background term is added.
 We look for the velocity that minimizes the cost function among a sub-space of 
 perturbed velocities

We get a sample of the velocity by computing the sub-space of velocity errors, and we add this perturbation to the background velocity.

As previously seen, it is not easy to find the global minimum of the cost function.
Therefore, the next step is to get a sample of all the potential solutions. 
The potential solutions are the solution that have a cost function value smaller than the minimum found using the Simulated Annealing algorithm. 
The mean of all these potential solution is represented below. 
Looking at the variance of all these potential solutions, we can assess the reliability of this velocity field. 
On the first line, the observed field are plotted. From the left to the right, there is the velocity field plotted over the SST tracer, the FSLE, the SSH.
On the second line the corrected field are plotted.

  \begin{block}{}
   \textbf{Sub-mesoscale information are invertible to control larger scales dynamics}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Altimetry and tracer observations are complementary.
    \item Tracer information can compensate for the lack of SSH resolution in time and space.
    \item High resolution Sea Surface Temperature or Ocean Color data are useful to control ocean physics. 
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Twin experiment in an idealized coupled physico-biogeochemical model to assess the quality of the correction.
    \item  Data Assimilation of image in a coupled physico-biogeochemical model.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \note{ 
In this study, the altimetric and the tracer image observation are used together to improve the assessment the dynamic at small scales. 
We can compensate for the lack of spatial and temporal resolution using information from tracer images.
It is feasible to invert sub-mesoscale tracer information for the control of dynamic in the ocean at larger scale.
However, There is no way to assess the improvement made on the velocity during the process of correction because we do not know the truth.   
Now that we have proven the reliability of this method in a real case, we need to assess the reliability of the solution . 
The next step is to use a physico-biogeochemical coupled model. The high resolution model is a channel configuration, able to generate few eddies using a baroclinic instability.
Using this model, we will have access to the truth so that we can assess the reliability of the solution of this method. 

The goal of this study is also to develop Data Assimilation of images in a physical biogeochemical model in order to improve the prediction of oceanic circulations. 
%
%%Still, we need to quantify the error made on this new estimation of the velocity. 
%%A similar study on a coupled physico-biogeochemical model should be interesting to improve the method and quantify the resulting error.
