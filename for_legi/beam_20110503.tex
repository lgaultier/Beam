  \note{Lately, Some Lagrangian tools such as Lyapunov exponents have demonstrated to be a good proxy of the sub-mesoscale stirring in the ocean. The stretching lines and the local stirring can be derived using altimetric mesoscale velocity. The filaments are very similar to the frontal structure found in tracers as you can see on the sea surface temperature. The goal of this study is to prove that the inversion is feasible ; from a submesoscale image tracer, we want to correct the mesoscale velocity using Lyapunov Exponent as a proxy. We must prove that Lyapunov exponents are invertible into larger scales velocity before doing the full inversion. }

  Minimization of this cost function complex because of many local minima
  \note{The first step is to build a velocity error panel using PCA. 
We have to do the PCA using all data available on the chosen area, which mean we have a space of EOF as huge as the number of velocity field. 
This number can be reduced using the principal components. I decided to keep at least 95\% of the variability. 
Using the EOF we can build the velocity error panel, assuming that the distribution of errors is gaussian.
As the perturbed velocity is created we can derive the corresponding Lyapunov exponents image. 
The cost fonction is the distance between the Lyapunov exponents image and the observation. 
The minimization of this cost function is quite complex because of the strong non-linearity of the problem and the number of local minima.
